In this repo, we want to describe better the challenge about Life on Land (SDG15) and UN Biodiversity Lab (UNBL) for the CloudNativeHacks held on Paris in 2024.

Here we share with you few ideas...

# 1. Fighting Deforestation in Protected Areas: An AI to the Rescue.

Use the monthly Planet basemap to automatically detect deforestation in protected areas (or nearby) of a specific country and develop an interactive widget that shows the new monthly deforestation within these areas.

##Add an innovative touch:
- **Train an AI model**: Harness the power of Artificial Intelligence to automate deforestation detection, making it faster and more accurate.
- **Visualize in an impactful way**: Create a dynamic and engaging widget that presents information in an accessible and clear way, capturing the attention of anyone interested.
- **Deepen the analysis**: Go beyond simple detection. Analyze patterns, critical areas, and possible causes of deforestation.

##Benefits:
- **Early warning**: Quickly identify deforestation to take timely protection measures.
- **Transparency and information**: Share data openly and understandably, fostering collective action.
- **Valuable tool**: Provide governments, NGOs, and communities with an effective resource to combat deforestation.

##Additional tips:
- **Specify the country of focus**: increase the relevance of the challenge for a specific audience.
- **Briefly describe the widget format**: generate expectation about the user interface.
- **Mention potential AI techniques**: attract participants with diverse skills.
- **Highlight the potential impact of the solution**: motivate people to contribute.

# 2. Sister Sanctuaries

Unlocking Collaboration Through Data: use as many datasets as you can (or want) to uncover hidden connections between protected areas. By grouping areas with similar patterns, we could create "twin" ecosystems â€“ ideal platforms for sharing best practices, overcoming common challenges, and maximizing conservation impact. Join us in unlocking the power of collaboration for a healthier planet!

##Innovative Touch: Go beyond Basic Similarity Instead of simple pattern matching, leverage advanced techniques like:
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Identify complex, non-linear relationships between protected areas based on multiple datasets.
- **Network Analysis**: Understand the flow of information, resources, and challenges between similar areas.
- **Machine Learning**: Predict future trends and challenges based on historical data and shared patterns.

##Actionable Insights: Don't just identify similar areas, unlock actionable insights like:
- **Predicting Deforestation Risk**: Identify "twin" areas prone to similar threats, enabling proactive protection measures.
- **Resource Sharing**: Connect areas with complementary strengths and weaknesses, facilitating resource exchange and knowledge transfer.
- **Collaborative Research**: Enable joint research efforts between "twin" areas, tackling shared challenges with combined expertise.

##Benefits:
- **Deeper Understanding**: Go beyond basic similarities to uncover complex relationships and hidden connections between protected areas.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitate targeted partnerships between "twin" areas, fostering knowledge sharing and joint action.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Optimize resource allocation by connecting areas with complementary strengths and needs.
- **Amplified Impact**: Accelerate conservation efforts by leveraging collective knowledge and experience from similar ecosystems.
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Predict future challenges and inform proactive conservation strategies based on shared trends.

##Additional Tips:
- **Focus on Specific Datasets**: Instead of generic "10 relevant datasets," highlight specific data sources for added credibility (e.g., climate, biodiversity, management practices).
- **Target Specific Challenges**: Focus on a particular conservation issue (e.g., deforestation, endangered species) for deeper impact and engagement.
- **Partner with Organizations**: Collaborate with conservation NGOs or research institutions to integrate your solution into existing initiatives and tap into their expertise.
- **Develop Interactive Tools**: Create user-friendly maps, dashboards, or platforms showcasing "twin" areas and enabling knowledge exchange.
- **Consider Explainability**: If using complex AI models, ensure transparency and interpretability of results for user trust and adoption.
