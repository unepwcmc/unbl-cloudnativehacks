# 1. IDEA1:  Fighting Deforestation in Protected Areas: An AI to the Rescue.

Use the monthly Planet basemap to automatically detect deforestation in protected areas (or nearby) of a specific country and develop an interactive widget that shows the new monthly deforestation within these areas.

##Add an innovative touch:

- **Train an AI model**: Harness the power of Artificial Intelligence to automate deforestation detection, making it faster and more accurate.
- **Visualize in an impactful way**: Create a dynamic and engaging widget that presents information in an accessible and clear way, capturing the attention of anyone interested.
- **Deepen the analysis**: Go beyond simple detection. Analyze patterns, critical areas, and possible causes of deforestation.

##Benefits:
- **Early warning**: Quickly identify deforestation to take timely protection measures.
- **Transparency and information**: Share data openly and understandably, fostering collective action.
- **Valuable tool**: Provide governments, NGOs, and communities with an effective resource to combat deforestation.

##Additional tips:
- **Specify the country of focus**: increase the relevance of the challenge for a specific audience.
- **Briefly describe the widget format**: generate expectation about the user interface.
- **Mention potential AI techniques**: attract participants with diverse skills.
- **Highlight the potential impact of the solution**: motivate people to contribute.
